# Introduction
A task of Template Matching: Searching for a patch inside an M * N input image I that best matches a given query K * K template T. This assignment is implemented by GPU.
# Limitation
1.  The reference image I and the template T are grayscale.
2.  The template T is square.
3.  T is clipped from the reference image I; that is to say there exists a K * K patch (best match patch) that is identical with T without any transformation.
# Instruction
1.  Open the project.sln using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.
2.  Click the kernel.cu from the opened project.
3.  Press Ctrl + F5 to start the program without debugging.
